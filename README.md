# Manual-SQA-Roadmap
### **1. Foundations of Software Testing**
   - **Understanding Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: 
     - Waterfall, Agile, and V-Model.
     - Role of testing in each phase.
   - **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**:
     - Test planning, design, execution, and closure.
   - **Types of Testing**:
     - Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, and Regression Testing.
     - Differences between Functional and Non-functional Testing.

### **2. Key Testing Techniques**
   - **Manual Testing Concepts**:
     - What is manual testing?
     - Importance of manual testing in the SDLC.
   - **Test Case Design Techniques**:
     - Equivalence Partitioning.
     - Boundary Value Analysis.
     - Decision Table Testing.
     - State Transition Testing.
   - **Exploratory Testing**:
     - How to test without predefined cases.
     - Creating charters for exploratory sessions.

### **3. Writing and Executing Test Cases**
   - **Test Case Writing**:
     - How to write effective test cases (Preconditions, Steps, Expected Results).
     - Use of templates and best practices.
   - **Test Scenarios**:
     - Identifying and documenting various test scenarios.
   - **Test Data Management**:
     - Creating and maintaining effective test data.
   - **Test Case Execution**:
     - Running manual tests and logging results.
     - Capturing actual results vs. expected results.

### **4. Bug/Defect Lifecycle and Reporting**
   - **Understanding Defect Life Cycle**:
     - Stages: New, Assigned, Fixed, Retest, Verified, Closed.
   - **Defect Reporting**:
     - How to create clear and effective bug reports.
     - Severity vs. Priority of defects.
     - Bug tracking tools (e.g., JIRA, Bugzilla, Redmine).
   - **Reproduction Steps**:
     - How to reproduce bugs for accurate reporting.

### **5. Software Testing Tools (Manual)**
   - **Test Management Tools**:
     - Using tools like TestRail, TestLink, or Zephyr for test case management.
   - **Bug Tracking Tools**:
     - Hands-on with bug tracking systems like JIRA, Bugzilla, etc.
   - **Version Control**:
     - Familiarity with version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes.

### **6. Functional and Non-functional Testing**
   - **Functional Testing**:
     - UI/UX Testing.
     - End-to-End Testing.
     - User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
   - **Non-functional Testing**:
     - Usability Testing.
     - Performance Testing (manual aspects like load times).
     - Security and Accessibility (basic checks).

### **7. Agile Testing & Collaboration**
   - **Testing in Agile Environment**:
     - Role of QA in Agile.
     - Collaboration with development teams.
     - Sprint testing.
   - **Daily Stand-ups and Retrospectives**:
     - Understanding the role of QA in Agile ceremonies.
   - **Continuous Testing**:
     - Ensuring quality during continuous integration and delivery.

### **8. Soft Skills for QA Professionals**
   - **Attention to Detail**: 
     - Importance of being meticulous in detecting issues.
   - **Communication**:
     - How to collaborate effectively with developers, product managers, and stakeholders.
   - **Time Management**:
     - Managing testing schedules and balancing workloads.
   - **Critical Thinking**:
     - Understanding and analyzing the system for edge cases and hidden defects.

### **9. Hands-on Project**
   - **Simulated Projects**:
     - Test a sample web or mobile application.
     - Develop test cases, log defects, and report test results.
   - **End-to-End Testing**:
     - Plan and execute a full cycle of testing for a feature or module, from test case writing to defect logging and test closure.

### **10. Ongoing Learning & Certification**
   - **Certifications**:
     - Encourage ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) Foundation Level.
   - **Industry Best Practices**:
     - Stay updated with the latest trends in manual testing by following blogs, QA forums, and attending webinars.
   - **Self-Improvement**:
     - Constant practice on different testing environments and tools to strengthen understanding and expertise.
